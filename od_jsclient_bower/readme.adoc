= Usage

* invoke `bower install` which should give you a new folder `bower_components` with a subfolder `open-dolphin-js`
* Check out `https://github.com/svene/open-dolphin-examples/tree/master/od_cors_example` and started as described in it's usage instructions.
This will start up the server part of the application.
* Open the file `hellodolphin.html` which will show the familiar greeting GUI. It should work as expected.

= Remarks

* Note that in `hellodolphin.html` the dolphin is initialized with CORS support (`.supportCORS(true)`) so that we can use the server
part from our local file.
