= Simple JS

Simple _Hello world_ example using HTML and Javascript as client.
Therefore only the modules _server_, _shared_ and _webapp_ are needed.

== Usage

* clone repo
* `cd webapp`
* `./gradlew :appRun`
* point your browser to http://localhost:8080/appContext/hellodolphin.jsp

== Additional Info

`opendolphin-<version>.js` is accessed directoly from `hellodolphin.jsp` from https://bintray.com/opendolphin/resources/opendolphin/view#files[bintray].

To keep things this demo uses a JSP since that is supported by Jetty out of the box.
You could also use a simple html file if you replace the values in `webapp/js/app/api.js.jsp` with
the appropriate values.
