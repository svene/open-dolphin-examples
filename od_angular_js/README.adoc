= Simple AngularJS Example

Simple _Hello world_ example using HTML and Javascript and AngularJS as client.
Therefore only the modules _server_, _shared_ and _webapp_ are needed.

It also demonstrates how https://github.com/canoo/open-dolphin-ng[open-dolphin-ng] is used in form of
a webjar from https://bintray.com/opendolphin/mavenrepo/open-dolphin-ng/view[bintray]

== Usage

* clone repo
* `cd webapp`
* `./gradlew :appRun`
* point your browser to http://localhost:8080/appContext/helloangular.jsp

You can verify that the JSP is referring to the webjar and not to a locally installed version of _open-dolphin-ng_
by opening up your browser's development tools and inspect the network activity. You should find a GET request to

http://localhost:8080/appContext/webjars/org/opendolphin/<VERSION>/opendolphin-ng.js

`opendolphin-ng.js` is contained inside `open-dolphin-ng-<VERSION>.jar` which is defined as dependency in `webapp/build.gradle`.
